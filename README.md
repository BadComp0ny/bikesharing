# CitiBike
Review published data from Citibike for trends and use within Tableau.

## Purpose:
Update data within Jupyter Notebook for use and import into Tableau.
Create worksheets, dashboards, and stories within Tableau.
Use previously created worksheets to display data in a professional way within Tableau.

## Analysis
The city of Des Moines requested a business proposal utilizing the August 2019 Citibike data from NYC to understand if a Bike Rental business would potentially be successful in that area.  The data was parsed to identify opportunities utilizing location, gender, and time.  to determine if this would be a beneficial investment for the city.

## Summary
1. The target market for use of this should be men in urban areas seeking transportation to and from work.
2. The best times to complete repairs on bikes based on use in NY is between the hours of 1 & 5 am.
3. The peak distance should be within 5 minutes of most metropolitan interest.

## Opportunities for additional research.
1. While the NY data shows gives great detail this should be compared back to that of Des Moines as there are several factors that could invalidate a business case such as demographics, area of travel, cost of gas etc.
2. NYC is largely metropolitan with a large number of residents per city block. The population in Des Moines is traditionally viewed as less condensed with more of the population in an sub-urban or rural area.  
3. Consumables such as the cost of gas and taxes on vehicles being lower in Des Moines may mean that their are more who own and prefer to utilize vehicle transportation over that of bikes.
